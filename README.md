Requriments need to be in your system :
1. MATLAB Software: Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your
system. The code is written in MATLAB and requires the MATLAB
environment to execute.
2. GUIDE (GUI Development Environment): Which is MATLAB's GUI
development environment. You can create and modify GUIs using GUIDE
in MATLAB.
3. Image Processing Toolbox: The code involves image processing functions
like imread and imshow. Make sure you have the Image Processing
Toolbox installed in MATLAB to use these functions.
4. Operating System Compatibility: Ensure that your operating system is
compatible with MATLAB and its toolboxes. MATLAB supports Windows,
macOS, and Linux operating systems.

To install Image processing Toolbox package:
• Go to the MATLAB toolbar and click on the "Add-Ons" drop-down menu.
• Select "Get Add-Ons" or "Get Hardware Support Packages" (depending on
your MATLAB version).
• In the Add-On Explorer window, search for "Image Processing Toolbox."
• Click on the toolbox, then click the "Install" button to download and install
it

Steps to execute the project:
1. There are two way to access the project files
• Firstly choose any directory u wish to store the project files
,right click on the screen and select open terminal. Make
sure u have git bash installed
• And type the command git
• Due to this all the project files from github will be stored in
the directory or folder u want to save.
• Then open pycharm go to “Files” then to “Open” and select
the directory where u have stored the project folder and then
click on the project folder
• Now all the files would be imported to pycharm.
• Second way u can access the files in pycharm is by
downloading the zip of the repository .go to this link and
click on code and click on last option “download zip file”
• Extract the zip file at the desired directory .
• Then open pycharm go to “Files” then to” Open” and select
the directory where u have stored the project folder and then
click on the project folder
• All the project files will be imported.
2. Open MATLAB:
o Launch MATLAB on your computer.
Open or Create a New Script:
o You can open an existing script file or create a new
one using the MATLAB Editor.
3. Copy and Paste Code:
o Copy the entire code from the SignatureProject
function provided above.
4. Paste Code in MATLAB Editor:
o Paste the copied code into the MATLAB Editor.
5. Save the Script:
o Save the script file with an appropriate name and the
.m extension. For example, you can save it as
SignatureProjectScript.m.
6. Run the Script:
o Run the script by clicking the "Run" button in the
MATLAB Editor toolbar or by typing run
SignatureProjectScript in the Command Window
and pressing Enter.
7. Interact with the GUI:
o Once the script is running, a GUI window titled
"SignatureProject" should appear.
o Use the buttons labeled "pushbutton1" and
"pushbutton2" to load images for comparison.
o After selecting the images, click on "pushbutton3" to
compare the signatures and determine validity.
o The GUI will display a message box indicating
whether the signature verification is valid or invalid.
o Press "q" on your keyboard to close the GUI and
terminate the program.
8. Modify Threshold (Optional):
o If needed, you can adjust the threshold value in the
code (0.4 in the pushbutton3_Callback function) to
fine-tune the signature verification criteria.
6. Press 'q' on your keyboard to quit the program and close the video
window.
